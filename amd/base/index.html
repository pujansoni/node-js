<!-- We have a simple script tag to load require.js. When RequireJS loads, it looks at the data-main attribute on the 
script tag that loaded RequireJS and considers that as the application entry point. In our example, we set the 
data-main attribute to ./client/app and therefore RequireJS will try and load http://localhost:3000/client/app.js. -->
